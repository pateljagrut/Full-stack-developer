        <h1>Hello</h1>
    <div>
        <p style="background-color: blue;">I need to make a program that generates 10 random integers between 10 and 90 and calls two separate functions to perform separate actions. The first one (playlist) simply needs to print them all on one line without spaces, which was easy. The second one (savelist) is giving me problems. I need to write every num in the list nums to angles.txt with each number on a separate line in order.We use Python’s open() function to open the file and create a corresponding file object, f. The second argument specifies the opening mode. Files can be opened in a number of different modes, most commonly 'r' for reading and 'w' for writing. The mode we’ve used here, 'a', is short for append. It is similar to opening the file for writing, but will ensure that any lines we write are appended to the end of the file. Standard 'w' writing mode, by contrast, would cause us to overwrite the file from the first line.With the file open, we call f.write() with the line to write. We conclude the line with a newline character, \n. You may have heard that line terminators differ between operating systems – Unix-based systems use \n, whereas Microsoft Windows uses \r\n. Fortunately, Python abstracts this detail and we can just use \n regardless of our operating system.If we want to write more than one line to our file, there are a few ways to go about it. First, if we know exactly what lines to write, we can use a string with multiple \ns, or a multi-line triple-quoted string.</p>
